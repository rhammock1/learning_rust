// Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

// Traits are similar to a feature often called *interfaces* in other languages.

// Defining a Trait
// A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type.
// Different types share the same behavior if we can call the methods on 
// all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures
// together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.
