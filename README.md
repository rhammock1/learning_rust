# Learning Rust

These are mostly notes from the Rust book and some projects, from the book, and not. 
In some cases, the notes are in .txt files because there is more text content than Rust code.


## Notes to self
* start a new project with
  ```bash
    cargo new <directory_name>
    
    or from within the desired directory

    cargo init
  ```

## Goals
* Learn Rust
  * Create a Linux shell
  * Implement some of my other command line tools in Rust
* Learn WebAssembly
